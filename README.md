### Quick Start
Forest MQ is still in early an early state of development but
it is usable for test projects as it's missing some fundamental
networking security & stability requirements. 

To test Forest MQ end to end you can run the following 2 Python scripts:

- `examples/python/provider.py`
- `examples/python/consumer.py`

This will demonstrate that the message queue excepts messages 
pushed in over HTTP to the queue & the consumer script will
pop messages off the queue.
